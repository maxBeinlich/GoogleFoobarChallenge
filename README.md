# Google Foobar

Solutions to the [Google Foobar challenge](https://foobar.withgoogle.com)

## What is Google Foobar?

Google Foobar is an invitation only, coding challenge originally created for hiring new developers. The challenge is available in either Python or Java and consists of 5 Levels, totalling 9 challenges. These challenges are all connected by a rather enjoyable storyline and get increasingly complex the further you progress.

## This Repository

This repository containes the solutions from my personal runthrough of the challenge.

I **do not** incentivise cheating. 

## Structure

Every solution is structured in the same manner, starting with the challenge text and given test cases.

After that the solution function is implemented and called with the first available test case.
